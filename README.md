## Build and Burn

### Notes

The first working iteration was mostly derived from [this repo](https://github.com/dannyfritz/passport-example/tree/memory) by [Danny Fritz](https://github.com/dannyfritz)

I had to tweak it here and there because straight up copying it didn't work the first time. Had to trouble shoot to figure out why it wasn't working. One huge piece of advice that I got that really helped was "If you're going to try to make someone else's code work, look at the package.json" This was the final piece that I was missing. I thought I had installed all of the necessary dependencies in the first place but something wasn't exactly right.

I'm about to work on iteration 2 now. Going to delete the entire thing and start again from scratch. Hopefully round two wil be a little bit faster this time.
